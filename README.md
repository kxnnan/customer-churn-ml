## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses. Losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth.  

This project builds a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical behavioral and demographic data.

The system includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- ROC-AUC evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Model serialization for deployment
